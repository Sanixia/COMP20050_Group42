Test commit :D


Tasks to complete for Sprint 1:

1) assign an arraylist to each user to store their tiles
2) shuffle out tiles to players (same random number needs to be generated for animals and biome arraylists)
3) put everything together and create a menu
4) Someone pls add corresponding background colours to the animal string colours

x) early unit testing to make sure everything works



        /* rng player order */


        /* show 4 habitat tiles and 4 paired tokens */


        /* starter habitats randomly generated for each player */


        // upon a players turn :
        /* pick tile
           next command to show their habitat
           quit command to terminate program */


        // NOTES:
        /* there are only 5 possible starter tiles to rng (check manual)
           60 double habitat tiles (10 unique types) ,
           25 keystone tiles (5 unique types) */

        /* 2 players: 43 tiles }
           3 players: 63 tiles } 20 per player +3 for habitat
           4 players: 83 tiles } */
