Test commit :D


Tasks to complete for Sprint 1:

1) assign an arraylist to each user to store their tiles
2) shuffle out tiles to players (same random number needs to be generated for animals and biome arraylists)
3) put everything together and create a menu
4) Someone pls add corresponding background colours to the animal string colours

x) early unit testing to make sure everything works
